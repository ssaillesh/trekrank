# Roamly

An AI trip-night planner and travel map. Tell the planner your budget and vibe
and it builds a real, timed itinerary from live venues nearby; a separate map
app surfaces hand-picked hidden gems and can drop that exact itinerary onto
the map to see what's around it. The backend service (FastAPI/Celery) is
internally named **TrekRank** — it also does travel-logging: trips, distances,
friend & global leaderboards, badges, and shareable year-in-travel cards.

```

                                        ├──▶  Redis (leaderboards, cache, rate limit)
                                        ├──▶  Celery workers (geocode, distance, badges, share cards)
                                        └──▶  Object storage (local disk in dev / S3·MinIO in prod)

Geocoding: Nominatim / OpenStreetMap (free, no API key)
```

Everything uses **free / open-source components** — no paid APIs required. Geocoding is
the free Nominatim endpoint; share-card storage defaults to the local filesystem.

## What's implemented

**Backend (Python 3.10+, FastAPI):** auth (email register/login + JWT refresh +
Apple sign-in stub + forgot/reset password + GDPR delete), users/profile/stats/map/search,
trips CRUD + onboarding backfill, friends (request/accept/reject/suggestions), friend &
global leaderboards (Redis sorted sets), cursor-paginated activity feed, badges (24 seeded)
+ evaluation, group challenges, Instagram-Story share-card generation, an AI planner
(chat / guided "build your own" itinerary / options endpoints backed by live venue data),
hidden-gem hotspots feed, and a waitlist signup endpoint.

**3 Celery workers:** trip processor (geocode → distance → visited tables → stats →
leaderboards → feed → badge trigger), badge evaluator, share-card generator
(Pillow, 1080×1920 PNG).

**Web UI (`webui/`, static HTML/CSS/JS, no build step):**
- `index.html` — marketing landing page with an animated itinerary demo and a waitlist form.
- `auth.html` — the dedicated sign-in / create-account page: animated aurora background,
  sliding segmented toggle, live field validation, password strength meter, and a
  forgot-password flow. Any page that needs a session (the planner, the map's account
  menu) routes here via `?redirect=`; an already-signed-in visitor is bounced straight
  through before the page even paints.
- `roamly.html` — the AI planner chat. A short conversational wizard (or free-form chat)
  builds a budget/vibe itinerary from real, open-right-now venues, with live nearby events
  woven in on request. Each itinerary card has a mini preview map you can tap to open the
  exact same stops — plotted for real, with a route line — on `app.html`, in a new tab.
  Location sharing is a click-to-toggle pill in the header, off by default.
- `app.html` — the interactive Leaflet map: hidden-gem discovery (filterable by category),
  a rich spot-detail panel (street-level map + a real photo pulled from Wikipedia/Wikimedia
  Commons), the same Roamly planner as an on-map chat concierge, and — when arriving from
  a `roamly.html` itinerary link — the imported stops plotted with a "📍 Near your plan"
  filter that surfaces hidden gems around that itinerary.

**Tests:** 10 pytest integration tests (trips, badges, leaderboards, feed) — 8 passing.
`test_five_countries_badge` (expects a `streak_3` badge not in the seeded catalog) and
`test_global_leaderboard` currently fail; pre-existing, unrelated to the web UI/backend
changes described above.

## PostGIS

Trip coordinates are stored as plain `lat`/`lng` float columns (portable across any
PostgreSQL, no PostGIS required), and the default distance calculation is a Haversine
great-circle formula in Python (`app/services/distance.py` → `distance_km`). An optional
`distance_km_postgis` helper in the same module computes the equivalent via `ST_Distance`
over `GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326)` for deployments that do have PostGIS enabled (the
`docker-compose.yml` Postgres image is `postgis/postgis:16-3.4`) — the two methods agree
to within ~0.5%.

## Run it — Option A: native (no Docker)

What this machine has: Homebrew PostgreSQL 18 + Redis (running), Python 3.10.

```bash
# prerequisites
brew services start postgresql@18
brew services start redis
createdb trekrank

cd backend
./run_local.sh setup           # venv + deps + migrate + seed badges
./run_local.sh worker          # terminal 1: Celery worker
./run_local.sh api             # terminal 2: API on http://127.0.0.1:8001
./run_local.sh smoke           # terminal 3: live end-to-end test
```

Interactive API docs: <http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs>

```bash
./run_local.sh test            # run the pytest suite
```

## Run it — Option B: full stack via Docker

Brings up Postgres+PostGIS, Redis, MinIO, Prometheus, Grafana, API, and worker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
# API on :8000, MinIO console :9001, Grafana :3000, Prometheus :9090
```

(Docker isn't installed on the current machine, so Option A is the verified path.)

---

## Web UI

Static files, no build step — served by Caddy in production (`webui/Dockerfile` +
`webui/Caddyfile`), or open directly / serve with anything static in dev.

```bash
cd webui
python3 -m http.server 5173
open http://localhost:5173
```

`webui/config.js` is the single source of truth for the API URL: it points at
`http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1` on `localhost`, and at the deployed backend everywhere
else — edit that file if your API lives somewhere else. `render.yaml` / `webui/Dockerfile`
describe the deployed setup (Render backend + a Railway/Caddy static site for `webui/`).
